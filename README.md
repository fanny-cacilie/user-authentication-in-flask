# USERS LOGIN AND AUTHENTICATION IN FLASK

This repository aims to develop a basic Rest API in Flask.

The Web API consists in CRUD operations for the entity: users. Also includes other user operations, such as register, authentication, login, logout.

The users authentication methods were developed with **Flask-JWT-Extended**. And **passlib** to do the password hashing.

The lib **marshmallow** was used as a way to serialize and deserialize data with studies purposes.


## Installation

Install the required packages with 

`pip install requirements.txt `

## Running

Inside the directory, run:

`python run.py`

And you can test the Web API endpoints using Postman or Insomnia.
